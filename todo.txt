FEATURES:
--------
- Reduce the minimum number of connections required to scan information. Compression etc information can be collected in one connection
- improve TLS packet parsing
- handle case when server hello and certificate come in same packet
- crashing for 4shared.com
- some superflous files for x509 parsing. keyfactory.py pem.py pycrypto_rsakey.py python_rsakey.py rsakey.py tackwrapper.py
- Error in parsing certs for certain sites like facebook.com. Also, sometime for working site also get an exception
- fetching certificate packet is kind of hack. Make it more elegant 


TESTING:
-------
- Implement test suite
- Run pylint
- Run timing tests to optimize performance 

FUTURAMA:
---------
- Extract TLS information from pcap files
