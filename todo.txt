FEATURES (not in priority order):
---------------------------------
- determine all IPs of a given host
- validity of certificates
- add support for sslv2
- report result in json as well. 
- Reduce the minimum number of connections required to scan information. Compression etc information can be collected in one connection
- improve TLS packet parsing
- handle case when server hello and certificate come in same packet
- some superflous files for x509 parsing. keyfactory.py pem.py pycrypto_rsakey.py python_rsakey.py rsakey.py tackwrapper.py
- Error in parsing certs for certain sites like facebook.com. Also, sometime for working site also get an exception
- fetching certificate packet is kind of hack. Make it more elegant 
- Message if website does not support TLS. 
- Add documentation
- Use multiprocessing to make things fast
